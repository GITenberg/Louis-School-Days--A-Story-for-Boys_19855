description: The new boy in an English boarding school, Louis is an even tempered
  lad who tried to help other boys with their studies. But as he helped others, he
  fell behind in his own work, and so fell out of the good opinion of the masters.
  When he falls behind in his own work, one of the boys offers him the "key" book
  for exercises. Then Louis is accused of stealing the book from the master's desk.
